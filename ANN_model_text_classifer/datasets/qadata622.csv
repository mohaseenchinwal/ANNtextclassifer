(226, 226, 'http://www.icaewjobs.com', 'Banking Capital Markets 25 Home Treasury 12 ACA students The 3 important questions you should answer in your CV Standing out from the crowd is often challenging in the job application process especially when you are up against hundreds of other applicants You may be wondering how do I grab the attention of the recruiter or hiring manager The answer is simple it is the ability to answer these 3 vital questions 1 What interests you about this job company and industry 2 What value can you bring to the team and organisation 3 What is your current potential and how can you grow this for the future Think of your CV as your own living breathing personal marketing pitch a pitch that succinctly answers all those burning questions your audience i e recruiters and hiring managers have about you And the degree to which CV can answer their questions well will have a huge bearing on whether you are invited to interview So you must ensure your answers are strong clear tailored and relevant 1 What interests you about this job company and industry Above all the reader wants to know that you are genuinely interested in this job And when reading your CV they are essentially seeking assurance of this in the language and words you use They are looking for signals that indicate genuine interest and if they don t get them they will likely assume that you have just submitted a blanket application So before tailoring your CV for a specific application think back to what it was about this job that made you want to apply in the first place and why do you think you are such a good fit Was there a specific part of the role that excited you Does the company s mission particularly resonate Researching the company and industry may help you articulate this Once you are clear on your reasons for applying work on updating your personal statement and your cover letter Look back at some of the research you ve done and weave this in Demonstrating that you ve made the effort to do your homework at this early stage will only be a positive thing in the recruiter s mind 2 What value can you bring to the team and organisation Jobs are advertised because there is a need for a problem to be solved or help to be provided Therefore when reading your CV the recruiter or hiring manager will be looking for clear evidence of the value you would bring to the specific role and organisation A great way to focus the reader in on this is to update the employment history section of your CV When doing so ensure you focus on the value you added in each role rather than simply listing what your duties were This section of your CV shouldn t read like a list of job descriptions instead it should tell the story of your unique strengths and accomplishments A good way to do this is to think about what your biggest standout achievement was for each role no matter how big or small and focus in on that Remember the reader wants to know what you can do and needs to see concrete evidence for this And when updating each entry in your employment history focus on communicating the quantifiable value you added during that time A great way to help bolster your perceived value in the reader s mind is to use action verbs using these verbs will force you to focus in on what you achieved and the results you saw during each role 3 What is your current potential and how can you grow this for the future As the world of work evolves potential is becoming a more common gauge or indicator than years of experience when assessing the suitability of a candidate So the first step here is to clearly evidence your current potential what are you good at now and would you be able to do the job in question The recruiter or hiring manager needs to have come to the end of your CV with absolutely no doubt in their mind that you would be able to do the job and do the job well Obviously tailoring your employment history as I ve mentioned above to focus on the value you can bring will help towards doing this However there are other things you can do Try mirroring the language and keywords used on your CV with those on the job description this subtle change will increase your chances that the reader will see you as a good current fit Don t neglect the skills section of your CV include both technical e g digital literacy and soft skills e g creativity as this will give the reader a more well rounded perception of your current potential Also try to mirror these to those outlined in the job description where relevant This blog provides more advice on which skills to highlight on your CV to generate the most impact Add links to your LinkedIn profile and online portfolios of work these will help the reader build a better picture of your current competencies But recruiters and hiring managers don t just want to know what you are capable of now They want to know that you have potential to do great things in the future A fantastic way to do this is to demonstrate to the reader via your CV that you are ambitious and have an upwardly mobile career plan There are a few ways you can do this Articulate your ambition and future plans in your personal statement linking back to the job in question and opportunities you feel you would gain from it Within each entry in your employment history demonstrate how you have got better and better over time For instance each achievement you add to each entry in your employment history if you can make the next better and remember to quantify them Evidence your commitment to continuous upskilling by tailoring the skills section of your CV s weaving these skills into your employment history Also ensure your qualifications are up to date and include dates of completion so you can clearly demonstrate your commitment over time Don t try to gloss over any career breaks you ve had Instead outline how you used that time to generate value in different areas of your life and build your skillset By doing the above you are essentially indicating to the reader that you would be a good investment both now and in the future Ensure your CV is error free In this blog I hope I ve highlighted for you just how important it is that you ensure your CV is as relevant to the reader as possible and that it s absolutely imperative that quickly and succinctly answers the three main questions they will have about you However this hard work will be lost if your CV is littered with errors By making a concerted effort to ensure your CV is 100 error free you are providing another signal to the reader that you could be the right person for the job Above all checking for errors will build the perception in the reader s mind that you have a proactive and committed attitude When competition is so high the fact of the matter is that a simple typo could mean your CV is rejected regardless of how well you have answered the above questions As you would with any document whether it be an email or a PowerPoint presentation when writing your CV think about who your audience is and what information is most important to them And remember the questions each reader will have in their minds may well be the same but the answers they re looking for will be different So take the time to tailor your CV to each role you apply for and ensure you answer each of the above questions in a way that will really resonate About this author Jane joined Hays in 1994 as an Associate Initially recruiting within the Accounting and Finance in Scotland she progressed to Regional Director in

currently sits on the council for the CBI in the East of England How to find your balance between your career and your side hustle Are you thinking of starting a new side hustle or struggling to meet the demands of both your full time job and your side business In this blog I will give you some tried and tested tips on how to strike a comfortable balance between your career and the passion project you re pursuing on the side 1 Plan Plan Plan Organisation is key to achieving success in any venture so you need to make sure you re on top of everything A calendar either online or a physical notebook will help you be productive and manage multiple tasks and deadlines Some entrepreneurs like to keep their work and passion project calendars separate to avoid becoming overwhelmed and some like to just have one calendar so everything is in one place and deadlines are easier to sort out Figure out which method works best for you and stick with it Online calendars diaries wall charts and bullet journals are all perfect for keeping organised My top tip It s important to note that mapping out long term goals is vital for staying on track and remaining motivated I plan every single meeting and task in a big spreadsheet and always ensure each engagement takes me one step closer to my long term goals 2 Set aside time and space for your side venture Whether this is a couple hours in the evening twice a week or one day per weekend you should have a dedicated schedule for your side hustle This will help you stay motivated and don t end up crashing on the sofa in the free time you have from your full time job My top tip I find it just as important to have a physical space I can work from outside of my home this can be a local cafe or a workspace with free Wi Fi I avoid working in the places I usually relax because this creates the danger of associating my sofa or bed with work which leads to lack of productivity on one hand and lack of proper rest on the other 3 Look after yourself Working a full time job alongside starting a business can be exhausting There will be some days where you feel stressed fatigued and unmotivated so on these days it s important to take a step back and think rationally do you need a quick break or distraction to get your mojo back or are you experiencing burnout My top tip I usually take some time out to exercise have coffee with a friend or watching a couple of episodes of my favourite TV show Doing these activities always helps me regain my energy to get back at it to keep fighting and remind myself that the temporary stress will be worth it in the end However if it s the latter and I feel that I m on the verge of experiencing serious exhaustion and burnout I take a couple of days or even a week off This is because I know that I need to be healthy and well to achieve success and reach my goals In conclusion it s important to do the following Always have a firm idea of what your goals are for both your career and your passion project Dedicate set blocks of time for your passion project Keep well and healthy throughout the process both physically and mentally This will go a long way to helping you achieve success Written by Monique Malcolm Hay Monique Malcolm Hay is a recently exam qualified ICAEW Chartered Accountant and is currently working in Restructuring and Refinancing at PwC where she has just

stressful situations and you can t beat yourself up about the odd slip up here and there However as part of your interview preparation it is important to understand that a lot of the mistakes people make are both very common and easily avoided Put simply the more prepared you are the less likely you ll be to make them Here are some of the most regular issues we see along with some tips to avoid them Failure to arrive on time Unexpected delays en route to the interview are remarkably common Despite not always being the candidates fault this still leaves a bad impression and is difficult to shake off during the rest of the interview Whether fairly or not a late arrival will create the assumption you have poor time management skills You can never be too prepared when planning your journey It s highly recommended to practice your route in advance especially if the location is a place you have never visited before Aim to arrive at the building 40 minutes early you can always sit in a nearby coffee shop or cafe and continue your prep giving yourself enough time to look over your notes Take this time to calm your nerves firstly by breathing and then by putting yourself in positive and confident mind set This will leave plenty of time and you can ensure you arrive at the reception relaxed calm and ideally around 15 minutes early Forgetting about the company s impression of you Have you ever thought about all the people you pass on the way to your interview So often candidates are so preoccupied with their interview panel that they forget to acknowledge the other people they meet Bear in mind that the receptionist people in corridors or even those sharing your lift are all your potential colleagues and any one of them could be asked about their impression of you Having a good impact however briefly on these people will essentially make a good impression to your hiring manager They might not be the key decision makers but if you come across well even if just through polite conversation this will work in your advantage Lack of research in advance The most common question that is asked in an interview is what do you know about the company Skimming the website on your way in is simply not going to cut it Dedicate as much time as possible to learning more about the background of your chosen company A smart list of bare minimum items to check off would be the following Company values culture and atmosphere Social media content and brand messaging Past projects or case studies with big clients Publications press releases and marketing Controlling your nerves It s normal to feel nervous whether you re afraid of that awkward silence or just a build up of anxiety before your interview Ahead of time ensure you have structured your answers to the more predictable questions in your mind For example on our career advice page we talk about using the STAR technique when answering competency based questions Situation describe a situation you were in Task tell them what you decided to do Action describe what you actually did Result explain what happened as a result of your actions By using this framework and practicing the answers to some of these questions it will help you stay on track and allow you to cover your main points in a more controlled manner A lack of curiosity at the end One of the biggest slips ups you can make is to not have any questions ready for the end of the interview Questions at this point from anything not covered about the company to even asking about the hiring manager s own challenges will create an impression of curiosity Another great way to impress your potential employer is to bring note pad and jot down as they are speaking in case of any new questions that may arise as they speak more about the organisation and the role This will show that you were paying attention and interested in the opportunity So just remember that while mistakes are inevitable thorough preparation in advance and an awareness of the common pitfalls will stand you in a much better stead to perform well Don t forget to check out our blog article on what to do when your interview is over too For more information or

you a strong big picture answer Ask how they plan to do this and the cracks begin to show Having a vision of where you want to end up is important but of equal value is plotting a path to get there Investing time and effort into understanding how you can live your impossible dream will be less daunting if planned out Here are 3 tips on how to become what you dream about Fail to prepare prepare to fail Break down what you want to be and how you re going to get there into 5 10 or 15 year plans With this in mind the pathway becomes clearer Review yourself against these goals periodically by breaking them down further For example if I want to be a senior manager at my workplace within five years what extra responsibilities am I going to have to take on this year in order to achieve that Will I need more qualifications Do I need to start contributing more to the company outside of my job role This forward thinking mentality is an essential condition to achieving your goals Emblazon these goals in a prominent place Make this a part of your every day thinking It can t be something you have to periodically reset your mind on it needs to be a mindset Art begins in imitation but ends in innovation Whilst there are many well worn paths in the career world for the loftiest goals the pathway may not be so clear cut How exactly does one become a CEO of a FTSE 100 company or a politician or a producer Goals of this magnitude can seem so unattainable that one immediately rejects the thought But it is possible We know it is possible because people have done it before So research the paths that other people have taken listing common themes and exhibited traits in order to plan your own route This route may be more treacherous than other orthodox ambitions but if it wasn t then everybody would do it You re trying to do something special Learn from other people s successes and mistakes and take a few risks Opportunity Preparation Luck Top sportspeople work on their strengths until they become second nature and their weaknesses until they become strengths But for a businessperson how to work on your fear of public speaking may be a little less obvious than how to sort out that backhand So take advantage of opportunities that come your way to step out of your comfort zone because that brings growth If opportunities aren t readily available don t blame a set of circumstances go and carve them out yourself You don t know what will come up in an exam which is why you prepare for all eventualities To a far greater extent you have no idea what situations life will throw you into and you can t rewind and revise your leadership when someone asks you to lead a team for the first time So make a list of the things you aren t so good at and work on them day

closing date for applications is 29 August 2019 See job description The benefits of having a career mentor Your career mentor is someone who can help you achieve your professional goals and give you objective advice and support If you re ambitious about your career a mentor can help you succeed So why don t you have one Perhaps the reason you don t have a career mentor yet is because it s prone to the following myths 1 Mentoring is reserved for the most senior and well connected professionals within a business 2 You have to be working somewhere with an official mentoring scheme in place 3 This mentor has to be somebody senior to you who works at your company and 4 You have to commit to structured consistent meetings of a certain duration with your career mentor time which neither of you may have With all of these assumed provisos in place it s no wonder you haven t found anyone yet The truth is to find a career mentor all you need is a vision of where you at least think you want to be in your career the drive to get there and the confidence to seek counsel from whomever you deem inspirational and credible enough to help you With that in mind how can you find a career mentor Step 1 Identify your needs It is important that you start the process of finding a mentor by assessing your vision for your career Ideally where would you be in one year three year and five years time And which obstacles are standing in your way Don t narrow yourself just to the skills you are yet to learn or the feedback you were given during your last performance appraisal Think bigger picture Do you have a tricky relationship with a colleague or client and is this hindering your progress Is fear or a lack of confidence holding you back Remember your chosen career mentor will be someone you trust therefore they will keep everything you say confidential so don t limit your thinking at this stage To give you an example quite a few years ago I was at a turning point in my career I knew that I wanted to reach that next level but there was something that was going to stand in my way I dreaded giving presentations and it showed I knew that if I wanted to achieve my career goals something would have to change I would need to find a credible mentor to help me build my confidence and master public speaking which brings me onto my next step Step 2 Who do you know Once you have identified what it is you need help with it s time to find the right person to help you Who in your life has overcome the obstacles that you are now facing Are they where you aspire to be now Who do you know who is just really good at the skill you want to develop or perhaps the job role you would like to do in the future As I alluded to in the beginning don t narrow your search too much What s to say this mentor has to be somebody who is part of an official mentoring scheme more senior than you or even somebody you work with When searching for your career mentor consider former and current colleagues your friends and family as well as your other social and professional circles To continue the story of my own search for a mentor upon realising what I had to do next I thought about who I knew that could help me In this instance it was a senior colleague who I decided to approach This person consistently gave some of the most engaging presentations I had ever seen and was without a shadow of a doubt the right person to be my mentor The next step was speaking up and asking them for help Step 3 Be yourself The way you approach your potential career mentor will depend on the nature of your relationship If they are a contact from your professional network I would suggest sending them a message first explaining how they have inspired you what specifically you think they could help you with and politely asking if they could spare some time to sit down and chat Let them know the best number to call you on and that you hope they would like to talk further If this person is at your current organisation I would also recommend that you run this by your line manager beforehand They may be more familiar with your potential mentor or have experience in mentoring themselves and able to give you some pointers on your approach The point is your mentor needs to be outside of your direct line manager wherever possible Whoever your mentor may be the key is to be humble and human In my situation I simply approached the person and said I would like your help please I want to be able to deliver presentations as strongly as you can if you could spare an hour or so and give me some initial guidance that would be hugely appreciated At the time neither of us knew how much or little time this was going to take but as it turned out it was not a huge ask in terms of time commitment and it really helped me Many years on we meet on an ad hoc basis when I need their help and they are available to help me But establishing and maintaining this mentor mentee relationship took work which brings me onto my fourth and final step Step 4 Take care of the relationship Remember your career mentor is going out of their way to help you therefore gratitude and respect is key to both establishing and maintaining this relationship Before your first meeting and every meeting from thereon be punctual and well prepared Note down the specific challenges you are facing what it is you want to learn from them from this session and how you think they could help you You should also share the progress you have made from previous sessions and examples of this progress in practice For instance every time you meet your mentor maybe buy them coffee as a small token of your gratitude I always thank my mentor profusely for their time and relay any positive feedback from my presentations moreover how their previous advice helped me achieve this result To this day my unofficial mentor is great at giving me two minute feedback after any presentation if they happen to be part of the audience One good element and one to improve As I say you don t have to tick a certain box before being eligible for a career mentor You simply need to have a vision for your career and a methodical tactful yet authentic approach to seeking out this guiding voice Personally speaking finding a career mentor was one of the best decisions I ever made and is something every driven professional should pursue on their path to career success And remember bear all of this in mind the next time someone asks you for help too For more information or to discuss your recruitment needs

suggests some of our top 10 socially awkward situations at work are the result of not knowing our colleagues as well as we probably should But breaking down these barriers isn t just good for a comfortable working atmosphere it can be good for productivity too And while nobody expects you to be best friends with every single one of your work colleagues having positive relationships in the workplace can boost teamwork and make your job more enjoyable Just being more aware of what your work colleagues do in their jobs can improve your understanding of what they may need from you which can help you work together more effectively Here are 5 things you could do to build good relationships with your fellow workers 1 Be a good listener It s easy to get carried away when you re trying to get your opinion across But being a good listener is just as important when it comes to developing good communication with those you work with Try saying less and listening more Let your work colleagues have their say without interrupting them And if you want them to know you ve taken in what they ve been talking about try to repeat some of their points back to them That doesn t mean you shouldn t speak up or only make yourself heard if you have something important to say In fact it s a good idea to practice a certain amount of small talk at the office as it can help break the ice with a co worker you may not know very well and put them at ease 2 Socialise outside the office If you re the type of person who rushes back home at the end of the day whenever your work colleagues organise drinks or a similar get together you may be missing out You don t have to go out partying with them every night just aim to socialise with them every now and then in a non office environment Many people find it easier to relax and open up more in a social setting and they will no doubt appreciate you for making the effort 3 Venture outside your department Most people will know the people they work most closely with to some extent But what about your co workers in the rest of the company It s a good idea to try to mix with people working in different departments as it can help you to get a better understanding of the organisation as a whole So next time you see someone from another part of the organisation who you ve never met why not approach them and say hello 4 Tackle conflicts sooner rather than later Like any other environment where different people come together from different backgrounds opinions and walks of life offices are breeding grounds for arguments and upsets If you find yourself involved in a conflict with a work colleague try not to let the situation simmer Arrange to discuss the issue with the colleague in question as soon as possible and try to keep things professional At the very least you may agree to disagree but that s preferable to ignoring the situation until it gets out of hand 5 Be respectful at all times Finally try to be pleasant and polite at the office and respect your colleagues views even when you don t agree with them An office where people are respectful of each other will usually be more productive and effective than one where there s lots of gossip and negativity not to mention more enjoyable to work in How CABA can help Everything we do at CABA is underpinned by our commitment to provide lifelong support to past and

Industry Jobs Employer login Financial Planning Analysis 33 Greater London374 Legal 11 Somerset18 London344 5 steps to self promote In order to move forward within your career it is necessary to be your own biggest fan and communicate to others about your skills and successes otherwise you may find yourself stuck in a career rut Everyone has the right to communicate their career ambitions and so if you re not granted it ask for it This means insisting that your manager arranges routine performance reviews with you as well as other methods outlined below Making sure other people know what your career goals are will help make sure you re considered seriously for future opportunities and will give you greater control of your future career path Here are six ways to help raise your profile in the workplace and aid your career progression 1 Exceed expectations Performing well and exceeding your targets will show your employer a measure of your future potential This is without doubt the most fundamental way to elevate your profile in the workplace The best way to convince your manager that you re ready to take a step up to the next level is to start performing at that level in your job now 2 Communicate your successes Don t be afraid to make others aware of your successes If you are working hard and performing well don t be too embarrassed to share your success with your boss and colleagues This doesn t mean printing off your sales figures and sticking them up on the wall there are more subtle ways to go about it Try looping your boss in an email from a satisfied client or sharing insights you ve learned from a successful project with your colleagues Be sure to reciprocate and shout about the success of peers and colleagues too as it helps show you thrive in a high performance collaborative culture and aspire to develop best practice 3 Find ways to grow and develop Nothing impresses more and shows you are keen to progress like investing in the continued development of your own skills Your manager might only have a limited or non existent budget for your learning and development but that s OK as there are plenty of free ways you can further yourself Getting yourself along to industry events or searching out free online courses are great ways to start You could also request to shadow a colleague in another department for example 4 Get a career mentor To get noticed you need to be pushing yourself outside your comfort zone Find yourself a mentor someone whose career path you admire and who can give you regular guidance on what skills you need to progress The benefits of a mentor are two fold Not only can they offer you guidance and support they can also be a positive advocate for you to other people in the organisation or potential employers in their network in the future It s also worth stating that mentors aren t only for interns starting out in their careers we can all benefit from them no matter what stage of our careers we re at 5 Have a positive outlook Nothing will affect your reputation like a good attitude on top of your learned aptitude Get yourself into a positive frame of mind When you see a problem or challenge take a solution to your boss not just the problem Be enthusiastic to learn and take on new responsibilities whether this is through shadowing a colleague becoming a designated IT expert or volunteering to learn new skills and take on projects that go above and beyond your job description When your boss gives you feedback take it on board and act on it in a constructive and tangible way This will demonstrate that you are serious about your development and respect their views Above all it s about taking ownership of your career being proactive and taking the initiative without being afraid or embarrassed to communicate your successes and raise your profile in the workplace If you don t take control and take steps to self promote and push ahead in your career then who will If you

Finance Director CFO 27 Bristol26 Skype to success in 10 steps Skype interviews have become a common feature of the recruitment process so don t be surprised if your prospective employer suggests a virtual meet up ahead of a face to face interview Instead use these steps to prepare your brilliant virtual first impression 1 Set the scene First and foremost think about where you are going to have your Skype interview your home office Your bedroom Your kitchen Wherever you choose the lighting must be right try to avoid direct light sources or bright objects behind you as this will create a shadowy silhouette Think about what the interviewer will see in frame when looking behind you The background needs to be clear and not distracting The interviewer s attention needs to be firmly on you Once you have set up your interview room make sure you re not risking family friends or even pets walking in when the interview is taking place Let them know ahead of time that you have an interview and then close the door to keep out any external noise 2 Test it out The day before your Skype interview have a test run Organise a test call with a family member friend or use the automated playback feature this will ensure that the camera and microphone both work Run through some interview questions and answers and ask the family member or friend to provide you with any feedback 3 Practice It ll probably feel strange doing this However video recording yourself speaking your interview answers out loud is a great way to check your body language It also gives you a final opportunity to test your Skype settings the lighting and sound quality You won t want to suddenly become aware of these issues during the interview itself 4 Make your account more professional The first thing that your interviewer will see is your Skype profile photo and username so ensure both are suitable and depict you in a professional light If you already have a personal Skype account you could create a new account you can use just for interviewing 5 Keep notes off screen Before the interview print off your CV and prepare questions to ask at the end Make sure your notes are out of shot but clearly visible to you to use as springboards or prompts This will help limit the risk of being tempted to look down and simply read from your CV thus not maintaining eye contact with the interviewer On interview day 6 Get in early Treat the Skype call the same way you would a conventional interview turn up early Start the program up and have everything in place at least 10 minutes before the interview start time This will ensure you are ready and waiting when the interviewer dials in the last thing you want to do is keep the interviewer waiting 7 Dress for the job you want Whilst you may be taking the Skype interview from the comfort of your own home you should still dress as you would for a face to face interview even on your lower half you never know if you ll need to stand up Getting fully dressed up for the interview makes you look professional but also helps to put you in the right mindset for a formal conversation with a potential employer 8 Be engaged Try to forget that you re talking to a screen react to your interviewer as you would in person by nodding and agreeing keeping your body language positive and engaging However don t overdo it and be careful not to come across as unnaturally animated 9 Keep calm carry on Even if you ve done all the above perfectly you re still at the mercy of the machine Tech problems or issues with your internet connection may occur at any time It s important in these situations to stay calm How you react when things don t go as planned will reveal to your employer your ability to calmly and proactively tackle difficult situations Have an alternative contact detail a phone number or email address on standby in case things go awry and you need to continue over a different channel 10 Follow up After the interview send a quick email via your recruiter to say you enjoyed talking to them and learning about the role and the company Reinforce your interest in the role and say that you look forward to hearing from them soon This sets you up nicely for the next conversation Skype and other video interviews are becoming very standard so it s useful to remember these points and establish your own way of interviewing comfortably over the internet Through dedicated preparation and planning you can ensure your video interviews are always the most successful they can be About this author Thea is responsible for the

harder It should not be so severe as to make you anxious impact your ability to perform productively or affect your health or relationships Yes some stress is normal burnout is not 2 You re bored to tears At the other end of the spectrum you may hate going to work every day because you are bored and uninspired Boredom can be just as insidious as burnout leaving you feeling demotivated useless and lacking in confidence 3 Every day is Groundhog Day Despite repeated requests for more or new responsibilities you feel like you have been doing the same thing every day since day one Not only will this be personally trying but you should also consider how this lack of professional growth will look on your CV or to an interviewer Put simply by not learning anything new you are wasting your time 4 You feel left out of the important meetings the big campaigns any opportunity to shine You have ideas to contribute and know you re capable of doing more but you seem to be overlooked for less qualified individuals or for those who shout the loudest 5 You ve been overlooked for a promotion Despite your best efforts to improve and meet your objectives you don t seem to get the recognition you know you deserve Whilst it s ok not to be employee of the month every time if you have been passed over for a promotion on a few occasions maybe your skills would be more appreciated elsewhere 6

with the business she has led dedicated teams providing expert recruitment services for a wide range of sectors and professions with a particular focus on construction and property In 2018 she was appointed the Director for Permanent Recruitment working across Hays UK and Ireland to improve business performance drive best practice and shape Hays value proposition to both clients and candidates Wales23 Financial Analyst 55 Tell me about yourself Tell me about yourself ostensibly seems like quite an easy interview question In actual fact quite a lot can go wrong at this stage This is often the first question an interviewer will ask you and your answer will inform the entire basis of their first impression Also if you slip up here you risk feeling nervous and derailing your confidence and flow for the rest of the meeting That s why it s essential that the answer you provide is a good one By structuring your response you will be able to cover all the relevant points and keep the interviewer engaged with your story Here s how 1 Only include relevant points from your list of qualifications When answering this part of the question ensure you only include the experience and education that relates directly to your role Nobody cares about the paper round you had when you were 15 Instead provide your interviewer with a brief overview of your professional background and only mention qualifications that support your application With this type of answer in mind you have outlined only the educational and career history which is relevant Keep them engaged to prepare for your next point 2 Which key skills support your candidacy It s now time to discuss your relevant skills and development gained from your professional background and experience so far For instance in something like a marketing role you might say During my time in the industry I managed to apply what I learnt from my Master s degree and expand my knowledge further upon my digital marketing experience You should be able to support this answer through measurable examples such as campaigns or stats that you can claim credit for By this stage you now should have provided an overview of your educational and professional background and supported it with your key relevant skills and evidence to back up your points 3 How the role fits with your desired next stage of your career This should be the final part to your answer and is your best chance to tell your potential employer about your ambitions in a way that supports your application It can be useful to look at this as a trick question Although it may be tempting to talk about the reasons why you want to leave your current employer this should in fact be centred around why you want the role within this new organisation This way you will come across positive in your interview and show your potential employer that you re interested and enthusiastic about the role Putting it all together So by applying all of these golden rules in one go you can create something like this to confidently answer the question 1 I am business management graduate with a Masters in Digital Marketing Since leaving university I have pursued my marketing career for the last 2 years within the sports industry 2 During my time in the industry I managed to apply what I learnt from my Master s degree whilst expanding my knowledge further upon my digital marketing experience I believe that my skills are best highlighted from my recent email marketing campaign I lead increasing our conversion rates by 10 3 My previous organisation helped me develop the digital skills I have today however I believe that for the sake of progressing my expertise further it s time to move on Therefore I m looking for a more challenging role within a fast paced global organisation where there is plenty of room for me to grow as a marketing professional hence why I was so pleased to be invited to interview for this role Practice practice practice Practice makes perfect and by doing so you will be able to avoid the nerves and common interview errors of maybe forgetting what to say as well as displaying negative body language Your body language says a lot about you and can even be the deciding factor for you to succeed Don t let your nerves show through and affect your performance Use these steps above to start your interview strong plan a concise and positive answer that tells your potential employer why you deserve this role and why your experiences make you the best fit for the organisation If you are looking for support with your employment needs please contact your local office About this author Pam has been at Hays for over 20 years and is the Director of People and Culture working across EMEA Prior to her current role
